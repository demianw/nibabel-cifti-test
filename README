These files are intended for testing CIFTI-2 reading code.  There are 5 CIFTI-2 files, plus two gifti surfaces and a nifti volume, for visualization purposes.

The files:

Conte69.MyelinAndCorrThickness.32k_fs_LR.dscalar.nii
Conte69.MyelinAndCorrThickness.32k_fs_LR.dtseries.nii

contain the same data, which are two fairly smooth maps, with somewhat different value distributions (MyelinMap_BC_decurv ranges from 1 to 2, while corrThickness ranges from 1 to 4.8).  If you see a pattern that alternates from one vertex to the next, you have probably read the data matrix incorrectly, which may happen if you previously read data from CIFTI-1, and used the same code.  The CIFTI-2 matrix data should be read as a standard NIFTI-2 file, it does not require the special treatment that CIFTI-1 needed.

The "ones.dscalar.nii" is the only cifti file in the zip that contains voxel data.  All of the data values are 1.  The various volume components should align well with subcortical structures in "Conte69_AverageT1w_restore.nii.gz".

The files:

Conte69.MyelinAndCorrThickness.32k_fs_LR.ptseries.nii
Conte69.parcellations_VGD11b.32k_fs_LR.dlabel.nii

should have the first map of the .dlabel.nii file align with the areas in the .ptseries.nii file that have values.  The values in the .ptseries.nii file should match the vertex averages over the regions they cover, from the same-index map in "Conte69.MyelinAndCorrThickness.32k_fs_LR.dtseries.nii".
